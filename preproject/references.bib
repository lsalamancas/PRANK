abstract = {A glance on history of the study of human locomotion is given. Major landmarks and most significant contributors are mentioned, that have pursued the development of the approaches intended to get to know the phenomenon of gross human body movement and locomotion. Time period since Antiquity until our days is encompassed. Contribution of each new arising technology (in modern times these were, for instance, high-speed photography, digital computers, new types of sensing, etc.) is outlined. Chapter ends with pinpointing elements of currently attained methodology and paradigms for studying the phenomenon, combining biomechanical approach behind modern measurement, modeling and diagnostics systems, with exercise physiology approach comprising measurement and testing of pulmonary and cardiovascular systems' performance.},
