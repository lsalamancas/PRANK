   abstract = {The ankle joint complex (AJC) is of fundamental importance for balance, support, and propulsion. However, it is particularly susceptible to musculoskeletal and neurological injuries, especially neurological injuries such as drop foot following stroke. An important factor in ankle dysfunction is damage to the central nervous system (CNS). Correspondingly, the fundamental goal of rehabilitation training is to stimulate the reorganization and compensation of the CNS, and to promote the recovery of the motor system’s motor perception function. Therefore, an increasing number of ankle rehabilitation robots have been developed to provide long-term accurate and uniform rehabilitation training of the AJC, among which the parallel ankle rehabilitation robot (PARR) is the most studied. The aim of this study is to provide a systematic review of the state of the art in PARR technology, with consideration of the mechanism configurations, actuator types with different trajectory tracking control techniques, and rehabilitation training methods, thus facilitating the development of new and improved PARRs as a next step towards obtaining clinical proof of their rehabilitation benefits.},

   abstract = {Rehabilitation robotics is an evolving area of active research and recently novel mechanisms have been proposed to reinstate complex human movements. Parallel robots are of particular interest to researchers since they are rigid and can provide enough load capacity for human joint movements. This paper proposes a soft parallel robot (SPR) for ankle joint rehabilitation. Kinematic workspace analysis is carried out and the singularity criterion of the SPR’s Jacobian matrix is used to define the feasible workspace. A global conditioning number (GCN) is defined using the Jacobian matrix as a performance index for the evaluation of the robot design. An optimization problem is formulated to minimize the GCN using modified genetic algorithm (GA). Results from simple GA and modified GA are compared and discussed. As a result of the optimization, an optimal robot design is obtained which has a near unity GCN with almost uniform distribution in the entire feasible workspace of the robot.},

   abstract = {Dimensional synthesis is one of the most difficult issues in the field of parallel robots with actuation redundancy. To deal with the optimal design of a redundantly actuated parallel robot used for ankle rehabilitation, a methodology of dimensional synthesis based on multi-objective optimization is presented. First, the dimensional synthesis of the redundant parallel robot is formulated as a nonlinear constrained multi-objective optimization problem. Then four objective functions, separately reflecting occupied space, input/output transmission and torque performances, and multi-criteria constraints, such as dimension, interference and kinematics, are defined. In consideration of the passive exercise of plantar/dorsiflexion requiring large output moment, a torque index is proposed. To cope with the actuation redundancy of the parallel robot, a new output transmission index is defined as well. The multi-objective optimization problem is solved by using a modified Differential Evolution(DE) algorithm, which is characterized by new selection and mutation strategies. Meanwhile, a special penalty method is presented to tackle the multi-criteria constraints. Finally, numerical experiments for different optimization algorithms are implemented. The computation results show that the proposed indices of output transmission and torque, and constraint handling are effective for the redundant parallel robot; the modified DE algorithm is superior to the other tested algorithms, in terms of the ability of global search and the number of non-dominated solutions. The proposed methodology of multi-objective optimization can be also applied to the dimensional synthesis of other redundantly actuated parallel robots only with rotational movements.},

Then, a passive compliance training strategy based on admittance control is described in detail and is implemented on our PARR. Findings Experiments involving healthy subjects were conducted, and the performance of trajectory tracking was quantitatively evaluated, with the results showing excellent compliance and trajectory tracking accuracy, which can ensure that a secondary injury to the AJC during passive rehabilitation training is avoided. The influence of different admittance parameters was also simulated and analysed, which can contribute to the development of adaptive parameter adjustment research. Originality/value The paper can be used to improve the effectiveness of ankle rehabilitation, to alleviate manual therapy problems in terms of labour intensiveness, precision and subjectivity and to ensure safety and comfort during rehabilitation sessions.},

   abstract = {Robots are being increasingly used by physical therapists to carry out rehabilitation treatments owing to their ability of providing repetitive, controlled, and autonomous training sessions. Enhanced treatment outcomes can be achieved by encouraging patients' active participation besides robotic assistance. Advanced control strategies are required to be designed and implemented for the rehabilitation robots in order to persuade patients to contribute actively during the treatments. In this paper, an adaptive impedance control approach is developed and implemented on a parallel ankle rehabilitation robot. The ankle robot was designed based on a parallel mechanism and actuated using four pneumatic muscle actuators (PMAs) to provide three rotational degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) to the ankle joint. The proposed controller adapts the parallel robot's impedance according to the patients' active participation to provide customized robotic assistance. In order to evaluate performance of the proposed controller, experiments were conducted with stroke patients. It is demonstrated from the experimental results that the robotic assistance decreases as a result of patients' active participation. Similarly, increased robotics assistance is recorded in response to decrease in patient's participation in the rehabilitation process. This work will aid in the further development of customized robot-assisted physical therapy of ankle joint impairment.},

Parallel robots exhibit highly coupled non-linear motions hence conventionally a unique closed form solution of their FK cannot be obtained. However, since FK is a key module in closed loop position and force control, its accurate and fast solution is indispensable. To solve the FK problem, a modified fuzzy inference system (FIS) is proposed in this paper for the first time which is time efficient and becomes very accurate when its parameters are optimized. In the proposed work, FIS has been optimized using three approaches namely: gradient descent (GD), genetic algorithm (GA) and modified genetic algorithm (MGA). The FIS, optimized by MGA has been found to be more accurate than the GD and GA optimized FIS. Performance of the MGA based fuzzy system has been found better both in terms of accuracy and computation time, when compared with Newton–Raphson iterative method and other fuzzy and neural approaches.},

Singularity analysis of the design revealed that a redundantly actuated robot is required to avoid singularity in the workspace. Kinematic parameters of the robot were selected so that the available workspace could closely match the available ankle ROM.

Included studies mainly consist of selected papers in two published reviews involving a variety of robot-assisted ankle rehabilitation techniques. A free search was also made in Google Scholar and Scopus by using keywords ?ankle??,? and ?robot??,? and (?rehabilitat??? or ?treat???). The search is limited to English-language articles published between January 1980 and September 2016. Results show that existing robot-assisted ankle rehabilitation techniques can be classified into wearable exoskeleton and platform-based devices. Platform-based devices are mostly developed for the treatment of a variety of ankle musculoskeletal and neurological injuries, while wearable ones focus more on ankle-related gait training. In terms of robot design, comparative analysis indicates that an ideal ankle rehabilitation robot should have aligned rotation center as the ankle joint, appropriate workspace, and actuation torque, no matter how many degrees of freedom (DOFs) it has. Single-DOF ankle robots are mostly developed for specific applications, while multi-DOF devices are more suitable for comprehensive ankle rehabilitation exercises. Other factors including posture adjustability and sensing functions should also be considered to promote related clinical applications. An ankle rehabilitation robot with reconfigurability to maximize its functions will be a new research point towards optimal design, especially on parallel mechanisms.},

   abstract = {As the population ages, increasingly more individuals experience ankle disabilities caused by stroke and cerebral palsy. Studies on parallel robots for ankle rehabilitation have been conducted under this circumstance. This paper presents a novel parallel ankle rehabilitation robot with the key features of a simple configuration and actuator nonredundancy. The mechanical design is determined, and a prototype is built. Additionally, inverse position solution is addressed to calculate the workspace of the parallel robot. Jacobian matrices mapping the velocity and force from the active joint space to the task space are derived, and kinetostatic performance indices, namely, motion isotropy, force transfer ratio, and force isotropic radius are defined. Moreover, the inverse dynamic model is presented using the Newton–Euler formulation. Dynamic evaluation index, i.e., dynamic uniformity, is proposed according to the derived Jacobian matrix and inertia matrix. Based on the workspace analysis, the parallel robot demonstrates a sufficient workspace for ankle rehabilitation compared with measured range of motion of human ankle joint complex. The results of the kinetostatic and dynamic performance analysis indicate that the parallel robot possesses good motion isotropy, high force transfer ratio, large force isotropic radius, and relatively uniform dynamic dexterity within most of the workspace, especially in the central part. A numerical example is presented to simulate the rehabilitation process and verify the correctness of the inverse dynamic model. The simplicity and the performance of the proposed robot indicate that it has the potential to be widely used for ankle rehabilitation.},

Firstly, the kinematics model of the mechanism is established, and they deduce the inverse solution of positions as well as the velocity mapping between the driving speed and the robot's angular velocity, based on which they realise the trajectory tracking control in the process of passive rehabilitation training. Secondly, they set up experiments to determine the torque threshold that can be used to detect the motion intention of ankle joint, and then they propose the active rehabilitation training strategy according to the motion intention detection. Finally, experiments were carried out with healthy subjects, with results showing that the trajectory tracking error during passive rehabilitation training is very small, and the moving platform of the ankle rehabilitation robot can drive the ankle joint to the detected motion intention direction at a constant speed flexibly and smoothly, which verifies the effectiveness of the control strategies for ankle rehabilitation training.},

Based on singularity and workspace analysis, suitable robot kinematic parameters were selected for the redundantly actuated parallel robot.

The manipulator was modeled through application of Lagrange’s equations while ankle kinematics and dynamics was assumed to be based on the biaxial joint ankle model. A computed torque impedance controller has been developed to regulate the relationship between the applied moments at the ankle and the ankle rotary motion. To ensure accurate estimation of state variables, a kinematic self calibration routine has also been developed for the parallel robot using redundant sensing. To allow for further development of the controller, the recursive least squares algorithm has been applied to estimate the ankle stiffness and damping parameters. This information will be used in future work for stability analysis and controller parameter adaptation.

   abstract = {A glance on history of the study of human locomotion is given. Major landmarks and most significant contributors are mentioned, that have pursued the development of the approaches intended to get to know the phenomenon of gross human body movement and locomotion. Time period since Antiquity until our days is encompassed. Contribution of each new arising technology (in modern times these were, for instance, high-speed photography, digital computers, new types of sensing, etc.) is outlined. Chapter ends with pinpointing elements of currently attained methodology and paradigms for studying the phenomenon, combining biomechanical approach behind modern measurement, modeling and diagnostics systems, with exercise physiology approach comprising measurement and testing of pulmonary and cardiovascular systems’ performance.},
