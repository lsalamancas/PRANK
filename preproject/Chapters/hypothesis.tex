The developed parallel ankle rehabilitation robot, controlled via an admittance-based algorithm and integrated with a serious virtual reality game, will be capable of accurately estimating the ankle's range of motion (ROM). The ROM values derived from the system will show strong correlation and minimal deviation when compared to those obtained from a validated optoelectronic motion capture system, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of reliable kinematic assessment through the robotâ€™s onboard sensors and software.
