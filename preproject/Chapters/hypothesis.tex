The developed parallel ankle rehabilitation robot, featuring an adaptive admittance-based control algorithm and integrated with a serious virtual reality game, will accurately estimate the ankle’s range of motion (ROM). 
The system will support variable resistance modes tailored to the user’s motor capacity and rehabilitation stage. ROM measurements obtained from the robot will show high correlation and minimal deviation compared 
to those captured by a validated optoelectronic motion capture system, demonstrating the feasibility of reliable kinematic assessment through onboard sensors and software.
