Ankle rehabilitation is essential for restoring mobility and balance in patients affected by neurological or musculoskeletal disorders, such as stroke, cerebral palsy, or foot drop.
Robotic systems have emerged as powerful tools to deliver consistent, adaptive, and measurable therapy. Among these, \textbf{parallel robots} offer unique advantages in terms of stiffness, 
load capacity, and multi-degree-of-freedom control, making them particularly suitable for ankle rehabilitation.

% Mechanical Design Considerations

Parallel mechanisms such as 2-UPS/RRR, 3-RRS, and cable-driven structures have been widely explored for ankle rehabilitation due to their compactness and ability to replicate complex 
joint movements~\cite{Jamwal2009,Jamwal2015,Jamwal2016,Wang2015,Zhang2018,Zhang2019}. Optimization techniques including genetic algorithms and differential evolution have been applied to 
improve workspace, avoid singularities, and enhance isotropy~\cite{Tsoi2009,Li2020Mechanical, ShahNazar2022}.

%\section{Actuation and Compliance Strategies}

Actuation methods vary from pneumatic muscle actuators (PMAs)~\cite{Jamwal2015} to series elastic actuators (SEAs) and cable-driven systems~\cite{Zhang2018, ceccarelli2023portable}.
Compliance is critical for safety and adaptability, especially in early rehabilitation stages. Passive and active compliance strategies have been proposed to reduce joint stress and accommodate patient variability~\cite{Li2020passive, singh2025design}.

%%\section{Control Algorithms and Patient Interaction}

Advanced control strategies such as adaptive impedance control, fuzzy logic, and patient-cooperative control have been developed to enhance engagement and safety~\cite{liu2020design,Jamwal2016,Zhang2018}. 
EMG-based intent recognition and deep learning models are increasingly integrated to personalize therapy and enable real-time trajectory adaptation~\cite{zhang2021emg,  liu2022deeplearning}.

%%\section{Clinical Validation and Functional Outcomes}

Clinical studies have demonstrated improvements in range of motion, gait symmetry, and muscle activation using robotic systems~\cite{Dong2021, ceccarelli2023portable,ShahNazar2022}.
Comparative analyses with traditional methods such as ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) and functional electrical stimulation (FES) show that robotic therapy can match or exceed conventional outcomes~\cite{Miao2018, liu2021clinical}.

%%\section{Design for Home-Based and Modular Use}

Recent efforts focus on portability and modularity to enable home-based rehabilitation~\cite{ceccarelli2023portable,ShahNazar2022}. Reconfigurable robots allow adaptation to different patient profiles and therapy stages~\cite{meng2023multi,singh2025design }. 
Integration with virtual reality and remote monitoring platforms is also being explored to improve motivation and continuity of care~\cite{zhang2021vr, liu2022deeplearning}.

%%\section{Biomechanical Foundations and Emerging Technologies}

A comprehensive understanding of ankle biomechanics is essential for designing effective rehabilitation robots. Classical studies have established the role of the ankle-foot complex in propulsion, balance, and gait symmetry~\cite{Morris1977, Lin2006, Zelik2018}. These insights inform the kinematic and dynamic requirements of robotic systems, particularly in replicating dorsiflexion and plantarflexion patterns.

Recent advances in wearable sensing and machine learning have enabled more precise estimation of motor intent. EMG-based signal processing combined with deep neural networks has shown promise in predicting dorsiflexion and guiding adaptive control~\cite{Zaffir2021}. Cable-driven exoskeletons powered by series elastic actuators offer compliant assistance while enhancing gait symmetry~\cite{Zhong2022}. Similarly, soft robotic platforms such as T-FLEX integrate modular actuation and flexible interfaces for post-stroke rehabilitation~\cite{Gomez-Vargas2020}.

Virtual reality and telerehabilitation are gaining traction as complementary tools for home-based therapy. Systematic reviews highlight their effectiveness in improving postural balance and engagement in patients with neurological disorders~\cite{Truijen2022}. These technologies align with the broader trend toward decentralized, patient-centered rehabilitation.

Comparative studies between robotic therapy, ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs), and functional electrical stimulation (FES) suggest that robot-assisted interventions can achieve equal or superior outcomes in gait restoration and muscle activation~\cite{Stevens2015, Alnajjar2021}. These findings support the integration of robotic systems into mainstream clinical protocols.


\section{Challenges and Future Directions}

Despite progress, challenges remain:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ensuring compact, low-cost designs for domestic use.
    \item Achieving real-time adaptation to patient effort and variability.
    \item Standardizing clinical protocols for robot-assisted therapy.
    \item Integrating biosignal feedback and cloud-based analytics.
\end{itemize}

Future work should fsocus on scalable architectures, hybrid actuation, and intelligent control systems that fuse biomechanics, machine learning, and human-centered design.
