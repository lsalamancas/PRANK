This project encompasses the design, development, and initial technical validation of a parallel ankle rehabilitation robot (PARR) featuring an RRR configuration and admittance control. The system integrates real-time force feedback and a virtual reality-based serious game to promote engagement and adaptive therapy based on ankle range of motion (ROM). The scope includes mechanical design, electronic design, control system implementation, development of the VR environment, and a ROM evaluation strategy using an optoelectronic motion capture system as a reference standard.

However, the study is delimited to engineering and software development stages. It does not involve clinical trials with patients or assessment of long-term rehabilitation outcomes. Likewise, while the VR component is designed to enhance engagement, this work does not evaluate its psychological or motivational impact. Validation efforts are limited to simulations and technical comparisons with healthy subjects or artificial inputs to quantify kinematic performance and ROM estimation accuracy.
