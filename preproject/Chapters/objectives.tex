\chapter{OBJECTIVES}

\section{General}

Develop a parallel ankle rehabilitation robot using admittance control strategies, serious virtual reality-based games and an RRR electric motor configuration, adapting the difficulty of therapy based on real-time ankle range of motion (ROM) and force feedback.

\section{Specifics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Design, fabricate and assemble a 3-axis parallel structure based on electric motors to fit the controlled movement of the ankle.
    \item Develop an admittance control system that adjusts therapy resistance based on patient interaction, based on force feedback, ensuring adaptive rehabilitation.
    \item Create a virtual reality serious game to engage patients in interactive rehabilitation, enhancing motivation and adherence to therapy.
    \item Implement a difficulty adjustment algorithm based on real-time ankle ROM measurements to provide progressive rehabilitation tailored to the patient's recovery status.
    \item Evaluate system performance through simulations and subject trials, measuring effectiveness in improving ankle mobility, patient experience, ROM calculus and control algorithm performance. 

\end{itemize}
